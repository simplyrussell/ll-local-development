# Development in Local Environment

A presentation about developing with Docker

## Quick Setup

### Prerequisites 

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* VSCode with [Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### Clone Repo

I typically do this in the terminal as opposed to in VSCode. Punters choice.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:simplyrussell/ll-local-development.git
cd ll-local-development
code .
```

### Reopen in container

Within VSCode run the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command from the Command Palette (F1)
